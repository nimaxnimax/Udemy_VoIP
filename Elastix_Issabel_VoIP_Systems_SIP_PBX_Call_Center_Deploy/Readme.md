SIP vs Trunking vs VoIP

- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):**
  - SIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions involving voice, video, and messaging applications over IP networks.
  - It facilitates communication between endpoints in VoIP systems, allowing devices to establish and control multimedia sessions.

- **Trunk:**
  - In telecommunication and VoIP, a trunk refers to a communication link or channel between two points, typically used to carry multiple signals simultaneously.
  - In VoIP systems, trunks are used to connect a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or to other VoIP systems.

- **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):**
  - VoIP is a technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over the Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
  - It converts analog voice signals into digital data packets and transmits them over IP networks, allowing users to make voice calls using the internet rather than traditional telephone lines.

- **Port Numbers:**
  - In networking, port numbers are used to identify specific processes or services running on a computer or network device.
  - In VoIP and SIP, port numbers are used to determine which application or service is responsible for handling incoming data packets.
  - Common port numbers used in VoIP and SIP implementations include 5060 for SIP signaling, 5061 for secure SIP (SIP over TLS), and a range of UDP and TCP ports for media traffic.
